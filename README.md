# README-generator
For this project I made a README generator that uses your responses from an inquirer prompt to make an organized readme md file.

# Features
* The app uses inquirer to ask a series of qeustions that will be used to fill out the necessary areas in the readme.
* The prompts and main function is in the index.js file. 
* the generateMarkdown file contains the code that actually takes the information in and creates the readme.

# Installation
In order to run this application after cloning it, you will need to have node downloaded and install inquirer.
